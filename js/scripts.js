In total I had 6 groups of 10- 12 students. My main job at the beginning of my student’s stay, was to show them around Spokane, how to use Spokane Transit, and plan outings with them. During my first session I was flooded with tons of questions about bus stops, bus routes, where Walmart was, and just general confusion about how to navigate Spokane. Students often asked about my favorite restaurants or stores to shop at as well. The students received bus route maps as well as a map of Spokane, since almost all students do not have a data plan on their phones and rarely can access the internet when off campus. These quides did not fit the needs of the Mukogawa students, so I decided to design a guide to handout to my students that would assist them during their time in Spokane. /n The guide concisely contains information about Spokane, the bus system, and outings that is only relevant to the Mukogawa students. This is to help reduce the amount of information the students have to analyze and understand for what is often their first trip to an English speaking country.", thumb: "/images/print/spokaneguide/thumb.jpg", img1:"", img2:"", img3:"", portpage:"spokaneGuide.html", link1:"https://issuu.com/lillian.ragudo/docs/travelguide_lillianragudoprint", link2:"", link3:""},

A common problem that myself and my friends usually had with coloring books for adults was that they can be so intricate and detailed that you don't even want to start or finish them. In the end many are the opposite of relaxing.
